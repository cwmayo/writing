      The rain dropped down to my skin making it down the ground a puddle of water. She stepped on the water with her rain boots and raincoat, dancing in the rain. She didnâ€™t care if she was soaked to the bone, she only cared about how fun it was to jump on the puddles while listening to music on her earplugs. She was laughing, giggling, and running around, with no care in the world who was watching. She is the sunshine in the dark, and the flowers dancing in the wind, but most of all the life of the party.
