He didn’t know how to control it. His addiction to inhaling sharpies was getting out of control. It started when he was in his youth. He saw some friends inhaling some black sharpies as a joke, and decided to join in. However, he started to enjoy it a little more than any normal human being should. The delicious smells of those black markers made him feel a sensation of calmness, almost as if the markers had been laced with marijuana. From then on, he began purchasing more sharpies than one could ever possibly imagine. He loved sharpies the same way that Wallace from “Wallace and Gromit” loved cheese. Sometimes, he would even go as far as to steal other people’s sharpies, just to satisfy his addiction. One day, it all came back to bite him. He saw a sharpy sticking out of a man’s pocket, and had even more trouble resisting the urge to snatch it than Adam and Eve did to eat the forbidden fruit. He grabbed the marker out of the pocket, and the next thing he knew, the only black thing he had gotten was a black eye.
