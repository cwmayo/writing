When I entered the room, the smell of smoke filled my lungs. It burned good, felt like home. Sonny was up on stage, drunk and clearly not in his right mindset. His sax had recent dents, mostly likely from falling over. His blue coat showed stains from god knows where, and his 5 O’clock shadow was in full effect. As I walked over to the bar Sonny stopped his playing for a second to give me grunt of notice. I grabbed a whiskey on the rocks and sat down at my usual table. I listened as Sonnys music washed over and vibrantly filled the room. Somehow he always played better intoxicated. After he finished his solo he sat down by me to listen to the keys and bass trade some solos. We didn't say any words rather listened to the music and drank. After a couple of minutes Sonny downed the rest of my drink and went back upstage. He cued the drums for a fill, and they played. Leading up until he cut. The club was filled with silence. You could hear Sonny warming up his keys. And off he went. Notes cascading from the heavens themselves, or hell. It was like nothing I’ve ever heard. A full spiritual realization occured. Music to it's fullest extent. Fierce, beautiful, unwavering.
“There is never any end. There are always new sounds to imagine; new feelings to get at. And always, there is the need to keep purifying these feelings and sounds so that we can really see what we've discovered in its pure state. So that we can see more and more clearly what we are. In that way, we can give to those who listen the essence, the best of what we are. But to do that at each stage, we have to keep on cleaning the mirror.”
John Coltrane
