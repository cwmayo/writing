As Mr. Hare hops his usual path through the thicket, he quickly becomes bored. He lives in such a vast forest, yet he uses the same route to get back to his den everyday. He decided that he would not continue such monotony and that he would explore a little bit more of his homeâ€™s hinterland. So, when he got to the mossy log he always turns left at, he went right instead. There was no trail this way. He perished instantly.
