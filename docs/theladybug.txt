The lady bug crawled around the plant. She was so tiny. Everyone watched as each student separately took turns to review it under a magnifying glass. Millie was perplexed. She’d never seen something so beautiful before. Of course she was only 9 years old but it was still a new discovery. She reached a hand out onto the plant, making a bridge with her pointer finger. The lady bug crawled onto her nail and over onto the palm of her hand. She smiled a big toothy grin. She quickly clapped her hands together, smooshing the lady bug in between her palms. The classmates behind her let out a scream as her teacher whipped her head around. As she was getting scolded Millie pretended to feel remorse and hung her head down in shame. That was only the beginning of Millie Johnson’s downfall.
