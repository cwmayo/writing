The leaves painted the ground a beautiful red hue with splashes of green along the canvas, but even with beauty surrounding it. The tree felt sad it had been alone so long with everyone leaving him at one point. The birds that use to love to make their nests along his branches, the family of squirrels that use to nestle in him. The human girl who use to come, and play among his bigger branches climbing along them almost as well as a monkey. It was a time of happiness for the tree, all he had known. But at some point they started leaving him the squirrels heading outside moving to another tree, the birds deciding that his canopy wasnâ€™t as pretty, and finally the human girl just never came back. It really hurt the tree, yet a tree has no legs to walk or arms to crawl he can only watch. Wishing he was better wishing he was good enough for the animals to come back. As he felt the soil around him losing his mind to just the feeling of the earth he heard something the little sounds of buzzing. They were bugs all around him, he had never noticed them due to him always paying attention to the big animals. But these little friends brought a new reality to the tree they were all around him thousands, and he had never noticed. But now he did. And the once sad tree saw a brighter tomorrow.
