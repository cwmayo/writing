      Only starting from a seed, and only to be carved. Why was pumpkin to be picked by HER! She ripped me from my vine, then she didn’t even save and roast my pumpkin seeds. I dreamed of being a pie, but the decoration is just disrespectful. Will I just rot away or will be put out of my missier by someone who will run me over. She didn’t even make me pretty, she just cut into me like a monster. That is what she was too, a monster. I was scared, that's for sure. I started to pretend I am a pie. It’s the only thing that brings me joy anymore. I also think about my patch a lot. I wasn’t the biggest, and I wasn’t the prettiest but I had a good life. Now I just sit in this yard dreaming about what I could have been.
